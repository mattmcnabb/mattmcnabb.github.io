## What's one word to describe your work?

Challenging

Much to my chagrin, there's quite bit more to my job than just writing code all day. Along with a few others, I have to make sure that systems are up and running and secure, so students and faculty can get things done.

## What apps, software, or tools can’t you live without?

### Coffee!

### Software

- Visual Studio Code
- git
- Github
- Twitter
- OneNote
- Notepad++
- MSPaint (seriously)
- LastPass

### Favorite PowerShell modules
- Pester
- ActiveDirectory
- OneLogin
- MSOnline
- PowerShellGet
- PlatyPS
- PackageManagement
- AzureAutomationAuthoringToolkit

### Tools

- did I mention coffee?

## What does your workspace look like?
## What's a typical workweek look like?
I work Monday-Friday from 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM. When I come in I generally get settled in, check for issues, and spend some time preparing my week. Besides every day items such as tickets, there are always numerous projects up in the air
## What do you like the best about your role?
I love that I have the ability to work with a variety of different products/applications and in several different areas. On a given day I might be automating a process with PowerShell, or planning a project, or even responding to service requests. I've also gotten a chance to work with some great people from many different backgrounds, which is essential to keep you grounded and keeps the geek in check.
## What's something about you that no one knows about?
## What do you listen to while you work?
I don't usually have music playing, but when it's time to get some coding done, I'll fire up Google Play and strap on some headphones. I don't have a particular genre that I favor - I'll listen to classical, rock, pop, acoustic stuff, new age, jazz, etc. depending on my mood. There's a special place in my heart for classical guitar music - it's an instrument I used to play (badly). Some favorite artists that come to mind are:

### Rock
- Led Zeppelin
- Queen
- Pink Floyd
- Muse

### Pop
- Crowded House
- Sting/The Police

### Metal
- Metallica
- Avenged Sevenfold
- Black Sabbath
- Judas Priest

### Classical Guitar
- David Russell
- Manuel Barrueco
- John Williams
- Xuefei Yang
- Joaquin Rodrigo (Composer)

### Jazz
- Quintette du Hot Club de France
- Bela Fleck

## What do you wish you could change about your work?
I dream of working from home some day, but I'm not quite there yet. I've been working steadily on getting an office space ready, and have upgraded all the networking at home to support a home office. Hopefully within the next couple of years I'll be in a place to get that great work from home (or anywhere) job.
